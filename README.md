# CHANS_SD
The CHANS-YRB-SD model was developed based on the VENSIM DSS 9.3 software platform. 
The model includes six files, two for model execution, two simulation results, two validation data file.
Ensure that 'CHANS_YRB_SD_V1.mdl' and 'data_input_vensim.xls' are stored in the same folder. 
Then, open YRBmodel_ten_model.mdl using Vensim DSS software, click the Run button, and the model will execute. 
Vensim PLE allows users to view the model but does not support model execution.
For 'data_input_vensim.xls', variables shown in purple indicate those that vary under the future baseline scenario, with their projected values also displayed in purple
